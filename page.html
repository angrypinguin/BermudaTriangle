<h1>Info </h1>
<p>
The Bermuda triangle is a very controversial place in the world. Many people believe that it is nothing but a hoax. Others believe that something mystical is at work there. Over the years hundreds of planes and ships have been lost to the triangle. Some people blame the weather others blame supernatural beings. Most people try to fly or sail around the triangle if possible. Bermuda triangle is an amazing place. The history of the wreckage is crazy to learn about. There is an estimated 2,000 plus wrecks in the triangle. The number of deaths is unknown. There are frequent storms in the triangle and they are very unpredictable. Some say there are mermaids and sirens in the triangle that will lure unsuspecting sailors to thier death with thier voices. Some sailers say that beasts like the kraken live in the triangle. The Kraken is a giant squid capable of swollowing ships whole. The sirens are a part of Greek Mythology. Some people think aliens are the cause of some of the wrecks. There have been many books written about the Burmuda Triangle. One possible reason for the unexplained ships sinking is the methane deposits in the continental shelves releasing into the water and decreasing its density.
